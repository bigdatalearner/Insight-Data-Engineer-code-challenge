# Insight-Data-Engineer-code-challenge

WORD COUNT:

For first part of the coding challenge, I have created a py file reads all the files in the /tweet_input directory as a single string and parse them, counting all the word frequency in it and then output the result into /tweet_output/ft1.txt as a txt file.

MEDIAN VALUE:

For second part of the challenge, py file - median_unique.py dynamically reads all the files in the /tweet_input directory, calculates median of the the unique words and output the current running median into /tweet_output/ft2.txt as a txt file.
